# Active Context: Docker WordPress Development Environment

**Last Updated**: 2025-05-27
**Project Phase**: Automation Testing Suite Development 🧪
**Current Branch**: feature/automation-testing-suite  
**Current Status**: Testing Framework Created - Browser MCP Integration Needed

## Current Session Accomplishments - Automation Testing Suite
1. ✅ **AUTOMATION TESTING FRAMEWORK**: Created comprehensive 4-level testing matrix (micro-tweaks to massive overhauls)
2. ✅ **BRANCH ARCHITECTURE**: Established feature/automation-testing-suite with systematic test organization  
3. ✅ **TEST SCENARIOS**: Built detailed test templates with validation criteria and rollback procedures
4. ✅ **LOCALWP DISCOVERY**: Found NarissaRealty.com running on localhost:10004 in LocalWP environment
5. ✅ **BROWSER MCP TROUBLESHOOTING**: Identified browsermcp connection failure, attempted reinstallation
6. ✅ **REAL-WORLD TARGET**: Established Narissa's real estate site as primary automation testing platform
7. ✅ **VISUAL VALIDATION STRATEGY**: Planned screenshot comparison and before/after testing workflow
8. ✅ **BRANCH CLEANUP**: Removed obsolete development branches for cleaner workflow

## Current State  
- **Testing Framework**: ✅ Automation Testing Suite Created and Documented
- **Target Platform**: 🎯 NarissaRealty.com (localhost:10004) via LocalWP
- **Browser MCP Status**: ❌ Failed - Needs troubleshooting for visual automation
- **Test Scenarios**: ✅ Level 1-4 test cases defined with validation criteria
- **Development Focus**: Execute real-world automation testing on live WordPress site

## Automation Testing Strategic Approach
- **4-Level Testing Matrix**: Systematic validation from micro-tweaks to massive overhauls
- **Visual Validation**: Screenshot comparison and before/after testing workflow
- **Real-World Target**: Using Narissa's live real estate site for authentic testing
- **Browser MCP Integration**: Visual automation and screenshot capture (needs fixing)
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Test scenarios, validation criteria, and rollback procedures

## Automation Testing Development Plan
### 🎯 Success Criteria (8 Total)
- [ ] Testing Matrix Complete (4-level framework)
- [ ] Test Scenarios Defined (specific test cases)
- [ ] Browser MCP Integration (visual validation)
- [ ] Automated Validation (before/after comparison)
- [ ] Documentation Framework (reproducible procedures)
- [ ] Real-world Validation (tests on Narissa's site)
- [ ] Performance Benchmarks (speed and accuracy metrics)
- [ ] Rollback Procedures (safe testing mechanisms)

### 📋 Current Focus Areas
- **Critical**: Fix Browser MCP connection for visual automation
- **High Priority**: Execute Level 1 button styling test on live site
- **Medium Priority**: Build screenshot comparison workflow
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive testing capabilities assessment

## Technical Notes
- Project uses dynamic port allocation: WordPress (8090+N), VS Code (8080+N)
- Security bypasses acceptable for development/demo environment
- MCP servers provide enhanced capabilities beyond basic Claude Code
- Focus on consistency and ease of use over advanced features
