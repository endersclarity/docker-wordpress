## Current Branch: Browser MCP WordPress Automation
**Status**: New branch created with comprehensive automation focus
**8 Success Criteria Defined**: Browser MCP integration, automated WordPress setup, admin interface automation, theme management, content workflows, environment optimization, testing validation, and documentation

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Browser MCP Setup**: Install and configure Browser MCP server for WordPress automation
2. **WordPress Installation Automation**: Create automated WordPress installation and configuration workflows
3. **Admin Interface Automation**: Develop WordPress admin dashboard navigation and interaction automation
4. **Environment Preparation**: Optimize WordPress environment for cottage search integration

## Technical Notes
- Project uses dynamic port allocation: WordPress (8090+N), VS Code (8080+N)
- Security bypasses acceptable for development/demo environment
- MCP servers provide enhanced capabilities beyond basic Claude Code
- Focus on consistency and ease of use over advanced features
