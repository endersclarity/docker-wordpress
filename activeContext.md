# Active Context: Docker WordPress Development Environment

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-26
**Project Phase**: Disney Cottage UI Integration
**Current Branch**: feature/disney-cottage-ui-integration
**Current Focus**: Connecting cottage search UI to restored semantic search API

## Current Session Accomplishments
1. ✅ **CRITICAL**: Semantic search system fully restored and operational
2. ✅ **Complete Embeddings**: Generated 8.8MB embeddings file for all 458 properties
3. ✅ **API Integration**: Semantic search API functional with real similarity scoring
4. ✅ **Clean PR Process**: Successfully merged semantic search fix via focused PR #3
5. ✅ **New Branch**: Created disney-cottage-ui-integration branch with comprehensive planning
6. ✅ **Todo Structure**: Established 8 prioritized todos for UI integration work

## Current State
- **Semantic Search**: ✅ Fully operational with complete 458-property embeddings
- **WordPress**: Premium Narissa theme deployed with cottage search UI components
- **API System**: Flask-based search API ready for UI integration
- **Development**: Master branch stable, working in feature/disney-cottage-ui-integration
- **Next Phase**: Connect cottage UI to semantic search API for complete experience

## Key Decisions Made
- Focused on personal/demo use case rather than production deployment
- Prioritized rapid prototyping capabilities over enterprise security
- Selected Docker MCP server (ckreiling/mcp-server-docker) for natural language container management
- Designed multi-instance architecture with port-based separation

## Current Branch Focus: Disney Cottage UI Integration
1. **High Priority**: Connect cottage UI to semantic search API endpoints
2. **High Priority**: Test end-to-end search functionality with real queries
3. **Medium Priority**: Add loading states and search result feedback
4. **Medium Priority**: Implement property filters (type, price range)
5. **Performance**: Optimize search response times for UI interactions

## Next Session Priorities
1. Analyze existing cottage search UI components and structure
2. Implement API integration for real-time semantic search
3. Add loading states, error handling, and user feedback
4. Test complete search experience with natural language queries

## Technical Notes
- Project uses dynamic port allocation: WordPress (8090+N), VS Code (8080+N)
- Security bypasses acceptable for development/demo environment
- MCP servers provide enhanced capabilities beyond basic Claude Code
- Focus on consistency and ease of use over advanced features
