# Active Context: Docker WordPress Development Environment

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-25
**Project Phase**: WordPress Setup & Browser MCP Testing
**Current Focus**: WordPress installation and browser automation testing

## Current Session Accomplishments
1. ✅ **WordPress Deployment**: Successfully deployed WordPress at http://localhost:8090
2. ✅ **Docker Infrastructure**: WordPress + MySQL containers running and operational
3. ✅ **BrowserMCP Installation**: Installed and configured browser automation MCP server
4. ✅ **Development Workflow**: Adapted project for Cursor IDE + Claude Code workflow
5. ✅ **Context Updates**: Updated project structure to reflect current implementation state
6. ✅ **Setup Validation**: Confirmed WordPress installation page accessible and ready

## Current State
- **WordPress**: Running locally at http://localhost:8090 (ready for installation)
- **Docker**: Basic WordPress + MySQL containers operational
- **Development**: Using Cursor IDE with Claude Code (no VS Code container needed)
- **MCP Servers**: Browser MCP ready for testing with WordPress admin interface
- **Next Phase**: Test browser MCP integration and complete WordPress setup

## Key Decisions Made
- Focused on personal/demo use case rather than production deployment
- Prioritized rapid prototyping capabilities over enterprise security
- Selected Docker MCP server (ckreiling/mcp-server-docker) for natural language container management
- Designed multi-instance architecture with port-based separation

## Pending Work
1. **Browser MCP Testing**: Test browser automation with WordPress admin interface
2. **WordPress Installation**: Complete initial WordPress setup and configuration
3. **Theme Development**: Test WordPress theme development workflow with Claude Code
4. **Multi-Instance Support**: Implement port-based multi-instance architecture
5. **Documentation**: Document successful browser automation workflow

## Next Session Priorities
1. Use BrowserMCP to automate WordPress installation at localhost:8090/wp-admin/install.php
2. Test theme and plugin development workflow with Claude Code assistance
3. Document browser automation capabilities for WordPress development
4. Implement multi-instance support for portfolio/client work

## Technical Notes
- Project uses dynamic port allocation: WordPress (8090+N), VS Code (8080+N)
- Security bypasses acceptable for development/demo environment
- MCP servers provide enhanced capabilities beyond basic Claude Code
- Focus on consistency and ease of use over advanced features
