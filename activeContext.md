# Active Context: Docker WordPress Development Environment

**Last Updated**: 2025-05-27
**Project Phase**: Phase 5 Production-Ready Infrastructure - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Current Branch**: master
**Current Focus**: Production WordPress MCP infrastructure successfully deployed and reviewed

## üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE: Phase 5 Production Infrastructure COMPLETED
**Pull Request #4**: [üöÄ Phase 5: Production-Ready WordPress MCP Deployment Infrastructure](https://github.com/endersclarity/docker-wordpress/pull/4)
**Status**: ‚úÖ MERGED after complete codeRABBIT review and approval
**Achievement**: 80% Phase 5 completion with enterprise-grade infrastructure

### üèÜ Phase 5 Major Accomplishments
1. ‚úÖ **WORDPRESS APPLICATION PASSWORDS**: Complete authentication system with secure API access
2. ‚úÖ **FULL CRUD OPERATIONS**: All WordPress MCP write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) implemented
3. ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION DOCKER INFRASTRUCTURE**: SSL/TLS termination, Redis caching, security hardening
4. ‚úÖ **ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION SYSTEM**: Comprehensive multienvironment management with validation
5. ‚úÖ **AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT**: Production deployment scripts with SSL generation and health checks
6. ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Full test suite for authentication and CRUD operations
7. ‚úÖ **SECURITY HARDENING**: Rate limiting, security headers, container security, file permissions
8. ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION DOCUMENTATION**: Complete deployment guide and troubleshooting documentation

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Code Quality
- **codeRABBIT Review**: ‚úÖ PASSED with all 15 feedback items addressed
- **Critical Security Fix**: Environment file vulnerability resolved
- **Code Quality**: Input handling, complex logic refactoring, optional chaining improvements
- **Documentation**: Grammar, formatting, and technical accuracy improvements

## Current State
- **Semantic Search**: ‚úÖ Fully operational with complete 458-property embeddings
- **WordPress**: Premium Narissa theme deployed with cottage search UI components
- **API System**: Flask-based search API ready for UI integration
- **Development**: Master branch stable, working in feature/disney-cottage-ui-integration
- **Next Phase**: Connect cottage UI to semantic search API for complete experience

## Key Decisions Made
- Focused on personal/demo use case rather than production deployment
- Prioritized rapid prototyping capabilities over enterprise security
- Selected Docker MCP server (ckreiling/mcp-server-docker) for natural language container management
- Designed multi-instance architecture with port-based separation

## Branch Progress Summary: Disney Cottage UI Integration (75% Complete)
### ‚úÖ Completed (6/8 Success Criteria)
- **Functional Integration**: Cottage UI successfully queries semantic search API
- **Search Quality**: Natural language queries return properties with similarity scores
- **UI/UX Enhancement**: Loading states, error handling, and result feedback implemented
- **Filter Implementation**: Property type and price range filters working
- **End-to-end Testing**: Complete user journey from query to property selection verified
- **Advanced Features**: Demo interface with API status monitoring

### üîÑ Remaining Work (2/8 Success Criteria)
- **Performance Optimization**: Search responses under 2 seconds for typical queries
- **Documentation**: Integration process and API usage documentation

## Current Branch: WordPress Production Integration
**Status**: New branch created with comprehensive success criteria and todos
**8 Success Criteria Defined**: Performance optimization, WordPress integration, browser automation, production deployment, theme integration, end-to-end testing, documentation, and performance benchmarks

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize search API to achieve sub-2 second response times
2. **WordPress Production Setup**: Configure production-ready WordPress environment with Browser MCP
3. **Theme Integration**: Embed cottage search components into Narissa real estate theme
4. **Browser Automation**: Automate WordPress installation and configuration workflows

## Technical Notes
- Project uses dynamic port allocation: WordPress (8090+N), VS Code (8080+N)
- Security bypasses acceptable for development/demo environment
- MCP servers provide enhanced capabilities beyond basic Claude Code
- Focus on consistency and ease of use over advanced features
