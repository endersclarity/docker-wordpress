# Active Context: Docker WordPress Development Environment

**Last Updated**: 2024-12-28
**Project Phase**: Initial Setup & Scaffolding
**Current Focus**: Project architecture and MCP server integration

## Current Session Accomplishments
1. ✅ **Project Analysis**: Analyzed YouTube video transcript for Docker WordPress + Claude Code system
2. ✅ **Research Phase**: Used Exa web search to identify gaps and improvements in proposed system
3. ✅ **Gap Analysis**: Used sequential thinking to identify security, performance, and workflow concerns
4. ✅ **Project Scaffolding**: Applied `/user:architect` principles to create complete HDTA structure
5. ✅ **MCP Integration**: Installed comprehensive MCP server suite including Docker management
6. ✅ **Context Creation**: Generated project-specific CLAUDE.md and keymap files

## Current State
- **Git Status**: New repository with untracked files ready for initial commit
- **MCP Servers**: 5 servers installed (Desktop Commander, Exa, YouTube Transcript, Sequential Thinking, Docker MCP)
- **Project Structure**: Complete HDTA memory-bank with modules, plans, and tasks
- **Next Phase**: Implementation of Docker Compose configuration and setup scripts

## Key Decisions Made
- Focused on personal/demo use case rather than production deployment
- Prioritized rapid prototyping capabilities over enterprise security
- Selected Docker MCP server (ckreiling/mcp-server-docker) for natural language container management
- Designed multi-instance architecture with port-based separation

## Pending Work
1. **Docker Implementation**: Create docker-compose.yml with WordPress, MySQL, VS Code containers
2. **Setup Scripts**: Build environment initialization and instance management scripts  
3. **Volume Configuration**: Design persistent data storage strategy
4. **Network Setup**: Configure container communication and port management
5. **Claude Integration**: Test MCP server functionality within containerized environment

## Next Session Priorities
1. Implement core Docker Compose configuration
2. Create setup scripts for multi-instance management
3. Test end-to-end workflow from container startup to Claude Code integration
4. Document any issues or required modifications to original video approach

## Technical Notes
- Project uses dynamic port allocation: WordPress (8090+N), VS Code (8080+N)
- Security bypasses acceptable for development/demo environment
- MCP servers provide enhanced capabilities beyond basic Claude Code
- Focus on consistency and ease of use over advanced features
