# Implementation Plan: Docker Environment Setup

**Parent Module(s)**: [docker_setup_module.md]
**Status**: [ ] Proposed / [x] Planned / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Completed / [ ] Deferred

## 1. Objective / Goal
Create a complete Docker-based WordPress development environment that supports multiple instances, integrates VS Code through browser interface, and provides consistent development experience across different machines.

## 2. Affected Components / Files
*   **Code:**
    *   `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-container orchestration
    *   `Dockerfile.wordpress` - Custom WordPress container
    *   `Dockerfile.code-server` - VS Code browser interface
    *   `scripts/setup.sh` - Environment initialization
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions
    *   `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code integration guide
*   **Data Structures / Schemas:**
    *   Environment variables schema for instance configuration
    *   Volume mapping structure for data persistence

## 3. High-Level Approach / Design Decisions
*   **Approach:** Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers with dynamic port allocation based on instance numbers
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   Instance-based port allocation (8090 + instance number): Enables multiple environments
    *   VS Code browser interface: Provides consistent development experience
    *   Separate containers for WordPress, MySQL, and code-server: Modularity and isolation
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   `Port Calculation`: BASE_PORT + INSTANCE_NUMBER for dynamic allocation
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   Setup script → Environment variables → Docker Compose → Running containers

## 4. Task Decomposition (Roadmap Steps)
*   [ ] [Create Base Docker Configuration](memory-bank/task_docker_compose.md): Main docker-compose.yml setup
*   [ ] [Setup Environment Scripts](memory-bank/task_setup_scripts.md): Automated initialization
*   [ ] [Configure Volume Management](memory-bank/task_volume_config.md): Persistent data handling
*   [ ] [Network Configuration](memory-bank/task_network_config.md): Container communication setup

## 5. Task Sequence / Build Order
1.  Create Base Docker Configuration - *Reason: Foundation for all other components*
2.  Configure Volume Management - *Reason: Required before container startup*
3.  Network Configuration - *Reason: Enables container communication*
4.  Setup Environment Scripts - *Reason: Automates the complete process*

## 6. Prioritization within Sequence
*   Create Base Docker Configuration: P1 (Critical Path)
*   Configure Volume Management: P1 (Critical Path)
*   Network Configuration: P2
*   Setup Environment Scripts: P2

## 7. Open Questions / Risks
*   Resource usage with multiple instances running simultaneously
*   Port conflicts if instances aren't properly managed
*   File permission issues between host and container users
*   Security implications of running VS Code in browser
