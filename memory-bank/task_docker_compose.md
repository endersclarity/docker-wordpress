# Task: Create Base Docker Configuration
   **Parent:** `implementation_plan_docker_setup.md`

## Objective
Create docker-compose.yml configuration that supports multiple WordPress instances with dynamic port allocation, VS Code browser interface, and MySQL database.

## Context
Starting with a fresh Docker setup that needs to support the workflow described in the YouTube video: multiple WordPress instances accessible through different ports, with integrated VS Code browser interface for development.

## Steps
1. Create docker-compose.yml with WordPress, MySQL, and code-server services
2. Configure environment variable substitution for instance numbers
3. Set up volume mappings for WordPress data, MySQL data, and development files
4. Configure port mapping using BASE_PORT + INSTANCE_NUMBER pattern
5. Define networks for container communication
6. Add health checks for service reliability

## Dependencies
- Requires: [Docker and Docker Compose installed on host system]
- Blocks: [Configure Volume Management], [Network Configuration]

## Expected Output
A working docker-compose.yml file that can spin up a complete WordPress development environment accessible via browser on configurable ports.
