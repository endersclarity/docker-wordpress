# Branch Merge Strategy: React Components + Production Deployment

## Current Situation
- **Our Branch**: `feature/react-component-migration` - React component foundation for headless architecture
- **Master Branch**: Phase 5 production deployment automation (merged from production integration)
- **Conflict Source**: Parallel development of two complementary phases

## Strategy: Merge with Architectural Coordination

### 1. Preserve Our React Component Work
The React component library represents valuable foundational work for headless architecture:
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for cottage search
- React components with Disney theming
- Custom hooks for state management
- Component architecture for future integration

### 2. Adopt Master's Production Infrastructure
Master branch contains mature production deployment:
- Docker production configuration with SSL/TLS
- Environment management system
- Security hardening and monitoring
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure

### 3. Coordinate Branch Documentation
Update BRANCH_README.md to reflect combined approach:
- React components as UI foundation
- Production deployment as infrastructure
- Integration pathway for headless WordPress + React frontend

## Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Accept Master's Infrastructure (Immediate)
- ✅ Adopt production deployment configuration
- ✅ Accept updated project metadata and accomplishments  
- ✅ Use master's security and environment improvements

### Phase 2: Preserve React Components (Our Contribution)
- Keep all React component files from our branch
- Maintain TypeScript interfaces and hooks
- Document React integration pathway

### Phase 3: Update Documentation (Coordination)
- Merge branch purposes: React foundation + Production deployment
- Update success criteria to include both tracks
- Create integration roadmap for React frontend deployment

This approach treats our React work as the UI foundation for the production deployment infrastructure.
