## 2025-01-25 - WordPress Deployment & Browser MCP Integration

### WordPress Infrastructure Completed
- **✅ Deployment**: WordPress successfully running at http://localhost:8090
- **✅ Database**: MySQL container operational with data persistence
- **✅ Setup Script**: Automated environment initialization with ./scripts/setup.sh
- **✅ Volumes**: wp-content directory structure created with themes, plugins, uploads

### Development Workflow Updated
- **Changed**: Removed VS Code container dependency (using Cursor IDE instead)
- **✅ Browser MCP**: Installed @browsermcp/mcp for web automation
- **Updated**: Project architecture adapted for Cursor + Claude Code workflow
- **✅ Validation**: WordPress installation page accessible and ready

### Technical Implementation
- Working docker-compose.yml with WordPress:latest and MySQL:8.0
- Container networking functional between WordPress and database
- Persistent storage configured for both WordPress files and MySQL data
- Setup automation validates container status and provides access URLs

### BrowserMCP Integration
- **Installation**: Added browsermcp to Claude Code MCP server configuration
- **Status**: Server installed and ready for testing
- **Target**: WordPress admin automation at localhost:8090/wp-admin/install.php
- **Purpose**: Automate WordPress setup and theme development tasks

### Documentation Updates
- Updated activeContext.md with current deployment status
- Modified .claude-project.json to reflect Cursor IDE workflow
- Revised next priorities for browser automation testing
- Updated session accomplishments with deployment milestones

### Current Status
- **Phase**: WordPress Setup & Browser MCP Testing
- **Ready**: WordPress installation via browser automation
- **Next**: Test BrowserMCP with WordPress admin interface

### Key Learning Points
- Docker WordPress deployment simpler than anticipated with basic docker-compose
- BrowserMCP provides powerful automation capabilities for web interfaces
- Cursor IDE + Claude Code workflow superior to containerized VS Code approach
- WordPress installation ready for browser automation testing

## 2024-12-28 - Initial Project Creation

### Project Inception
- **Created**: Docker WordPress development environment project based on YouTube video analysis
- **Architecture**: Applied `/user:architect` principles for complete HDTA scaffolding
- **Purpose**: Personal/demo WordPress development with Claude Code integration

### Research & Analysis
- **Video Analysis**: Extracted workflow from "My New WordPress + Claude Code System" transcript
- **Gap Analysis**: Used sequential thinking to identify security, performance, and workflow concerns
- **Web Research**: Used Exa to research Docker WordPress best practices and Claude Code limitations
- **Decision**: Accepted security trade-offs for rapid prototyping use case

### Project Structure Created
- **HDTA Memory Bank**: Complete module structure with system manifest, roadmap, implementation plans
- **Core Modules**: 
  - `docker_setup_module.md` - Container configuration and management
  - `claude_integration_module.md` - AI assistance setup and MCPs
  - `implementation_plan_docker_setup.md` - Phase 1 implementation roadmap
- **Project Files**:
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines and commands
  - `.claude-project.json` - Project keymap and configuration
  - `activeContext.md` - Session state tracking
  - `changelog.md` - This file

### MCP Server Integration
- **Installed**: 5 MCP servers for enhanced development capabilities
  - `desktop-commander` - File operations and system commands
  - `exa` - Web search and research
  - `youtube-transcript` - Content extraction
  - `sequential-thinking` - Complex problem analysis  
  - `docker-mcp` - Natural language container management
- **Key Addition**: Docker MCP server enables natural language WordPress deployment

### Technical Decisions
- **Multi-Instance Architecture**: Port-based separation (8090+N for WordPress, 8080+N for VS Code)
- **Container Stack**: WordPress + MySQL + VS Code Server in Docker Compose
- **Development Focus**: Rapid prototyping over production security
- **Claude Integration**: Dangerous permission mode acceptable for containerized development

### Repository Status
- **Git**: Initialized repository, files ready for initial commit
- **Next Phase**: Implementation of Docker Compose and setup scripts
- **Priority**: Core container configuration and volume management

### Learning Points
- YouTube creator acknowledged Claude Code limitations vs Claude Desktop for complete projects
- Docker WordPress development requires careful volume and permission management
- MCP servers significantly enhance Claude Code capabilities beyond basic installation
- Natural language Docker management possible with appropriate MCP integration
