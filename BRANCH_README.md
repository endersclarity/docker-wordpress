# Branch: feature/react-component-migration

## Purpose
Migrate the existing Disney cottage search UI from vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript to modern React components within the Next.js headless architecture. This branch creates the critical bridge between the magical cottage search interface and the headless WordPress system.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] **Component Architecture Established**: Complete React component library for cottage search
- [ ] **Disney Theming Preserved**: All magical animations and styling ported to React/Tailwind
- [ ] **API Integration Functional**: React components successfully consume semantic search API
- [ ] **State Management Implemented**: Proper React state for search, filters, and results
- [ ] **Loading States Enhanced**: React-based loading states with error boundaries
- [ ] **Responsive Design Maintained**: Mobile-first design fully functional in React
- [ ] **Performance Optimized**: React components meet performance standards
- [ ] **Testing Coverage**: Unit tests for all major components

## Scope & Deliverables

### Phase 1: Core Component Structure
- Create base component architecture (SearchContainer, PropertyCard, FilterPanel)
- Set up component directory structure in Next.js project
- Implement basic prop interfaces and TypeScript definitions
- Create reusable utility components (LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary)

### Phase 2: Disney Theme Migration
- Port magical CSS animations to styled-components or CSS modules
- Implement glass morphism effects in React components
- Create Disney color palette as theme configuration
- Add sparkle animations and mystical hover effects

### Phase 3: API Integration
- Connect React components to semantic search API
- Implement SWR or React Query for data fetching
- Add proper error handling and fallback states
- Create API client for search and property endpoints

### Phase 4: State Management & Interactions
- Implement search state with debounced input
- Add filter state management (property type, price range)
- Create modal state for property details view
- Add loading and error states throughout component tree

### Phase 5: Performance & Testing
- Optimize bundle size and component rendering
- Add React.memo and useMemo where appropriate
- Write unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Add accessibility improvements and ARIA labels

## Technical Stack

### React Component Library
- **Base Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Disney theme
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- **Data Fetching**: SWR for caching and API state management
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for magical transitions

## Dependencies

### Completed Prerequisites
- ✅ Next.js 14 project structure established
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configured with custom theme
- ✅ WordPress REST API with custom endpoints
- ✅ Semantic search API operational
- ✅ Existing cottage search UI as reference

### External Requirements
- Semantic search API running on port 5000
- WordPress backend with MCP API enabler plugin
- Property data with embeddings (458 properties available)

## Migration Strategy

### Existing Assets to Port
```
Source Files (narissa-real-estate-theme/components/merlin-search/):
├── cottage-search.html          → React JSX components
├── cottage-search.css           → Tailwind classes + styled-components
├── cottage-search.js            → React hooks and state management
└── demo.html                    → Storybook stories or test pages
```

### Component Mapping
- **Search Interface** → `SearchContainer` + `SearchInput`
- **Property Cards** → `PropertyCard` with React props
- **Filter Controls** → `FilterPanel` with state management
- **Modal Details** → `PropertyModal` with portal rendering
- **Loading States** → `LoadingStates` with React Suspense
- **API Client** → Custom hooks with SWR integration

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Test all component prop interfaces and rendering
- Verify search debouncing and API call logic
- Test filter state management and combinations
- Validate modal state and accessibility

### Integration Testing
- Test complete search workflow from input to results
- Verify API integration with actual search endpoint
- Test responsive design across breakpoints
- Validate error handling and fallback states

### Performance Testing
- Measure component render times and re-renders
- Test with large property datasets (458+ properties)
- Verify memory usage and cleanup
- Check bundle size impact of component library

## Merge Criteria
- All 8 success criteria completed and verified
- Unit test coverage >80% for component library
- Integration tests passing for complete search workflow
- Performance benchmarks met (render time, bundle size)
- Code review approved with React best practices
- Accessibility audit passed with no critical issues
- Documentation complete with component usage guides

## Timeline
- **Estimated Duration**: 4-5 days
- **Phase 1** (Day 1): Core component structure and TypeScript setup
