## Technical Architecture

### Performance Optimization Stack
- **Caching Layer**: Redis or in-memory caching for embedding searches
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries and connection pooling
- **API Optimization**: Response compression and efficient serialization
- **Frontend Optimization**: Asset bundling and lazy loading

### WordPress Production Stack
- **Container**: Optimized WordPress Docker image with security hardening
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 with persistent volumes and backup automation
- **Web Server**: Nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination
- **Security**: HTTPS, secure headers, and input sanitization

### Browser Automation Stack
- **MCP Server**: ckreiling/mcp-server-docker for container management
- **Automation**: Playwright/Puppeteer for WordPress setup automation
- **Workflow**: Scripted installation, theme activation, and content import
- **Validation**: Automated testing of setup completion and functionality
