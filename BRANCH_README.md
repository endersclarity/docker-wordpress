## Timeline

### Phase 5.1: Authentication & Core CRUD (Weeks 1-2)
- **Week 1**: Complete WordPress application password implementation
- **Week 2**: Implement and test all CRUD operations via MCP
- **Milestone**: All write operations working on Docker WordPress instance

### Phase 5.2: Production Configuration (Weeks 2-3)
- **Week 2-3**: Docker production setup with SSL and monitoring
- **Week 3**: Environment configuration management and optimization
- **Milestone**: Production-ready deployment with performance benchmarks

### Phase 5.3: Advanced Automation (Weeks 3-4)
- **Week 3**: Multi-site synchronization workflows
- **Week 4**: Automated testing frameworks and content management
- **Milestone**: Advanced automation workflows operational on 3+ sites

### Phase 5.4: Quality & Documentation (Weeks 4-5)
- **Week 4**: Comprehensive testing suite and performance optimization
- **Week 5**: Documentation, developer experience, and final validation
- **Milestone**: Production-ready platform with complete documentation

### Key Review Checkpoints
- **End of Week 1**: Authentication system review and CRUD validation
- **End of Week 2**: Production configuration and performance review
- **End of Week 3**: Multi-site automation and workflow validation
- **End of Week 4**: Testing and quality assurance review
- **End of Week 5**: Final integration review and merge preparation

## Estimated Duration
**Total: 4‚Äì5 weeks** (20‚Äì25 development days)
- **Core functionality**: 2‚Äì3 weeks
- **Quality assurance and optimization**: 1-2 weeks
- **Documentation and developer experience**: 1 week

## Risk Mitigation
