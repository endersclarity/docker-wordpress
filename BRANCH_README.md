# Branch: feature/react-component-migration + Production Infrastructure

## Purpose
Implement React component foundation for headless WordPress architecture while integrating with production-ready deployment infrastructure. This branch combines UI component development with enterprise-grade deployment capabilities.

## Dual-Track Success Criteria

### ðŸŽ¨ React Component Foundation
- [ ] **Component Library**: Complete React TypeScript components for cottage search UI
- [ ] **Headless Architecture**: React frontend consuming WordPress REST API 
- [ ] **Disney Theming**: Magical theming and animations ported to React components
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Component optimization with React.memo and lazy loading
- [ ] **API Integration**: SWR-based data fetching with error handling and caching

### ðŸš€ Production Deployment Integration
- [x] **Production Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with SSL/TLS, Redis caching, security hardening
- [x] **Environment Management**: Multi-environment configuration system with validation
- [x] **Security Implementation**: Rate limiting, security headers, container security
- [x] **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite for authentication and CRUD operations
- [x] **Monitoring & Performance**: Sub-2 second response times with health checks

## Architectural Vision

This branch establishes the foundation for a modern headless WordPress deployment:

1. **Backend**: Production WordPress with MCP integration (âœ… Complete)
2. **Frontend**: React components with Next.js framework (ðŸ”„ In Progress)
3. **Infrastructure**: Docker production deployment with SSL (âœ… Complete)
4. **Integration**: React frontend deployed alongside WordPress API

    â””â”€â”€ api.ts                     # WordPress REST API client
```

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Disney theme extensions
- **State Management**: React hooks with SWR for server state
- **API Client**: Custom WordPress REST API wrapper with error handling
- **Performance**: React.memo, useMemo, dynamic imports for code splitting
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for component testing

## Legacy Asset Migration

### From Vanilla JS/CSS to React
```
Legacy Assets â†’ React Components
â”œâ”€â”€ cottage-search.html â†’ SearchContainer.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ cottage-search.css â†’ Tailwind classes + CSS modules
â”œâ”€â”€ cottage-search.js â†’ useSearch + useFilters hooks
â””â”€â”€ demo.html â†’ Next.js page with React components
```

## Dependencies

### Completed Prerequisites (Master Branch)
- âœ… Phase 5: Production deployment infrastructure with SSL and monitoring
- âœ… Phase 4: WordPress MCP Integration (custom MCP server, API discovery)
- âœ… Phase 3: Browser MCP automation framework  
- âœ… Phase 2: Security implementation and production configuration
- âœ… Phase 1: Docker WordPress infrastructure

### React Component Requirements
- Next.js 14+ for modern React features and App Router
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom theming
- SWR for efficient data fetching and caching
- WordPress REST API endpoints for property data

## Integration Testing

### Component Testing
- Unit tests for individual React components with Jest
- Integration tests for search workflow from input to results
- Performance testing for component rendering and state updates
- Accessibility testing for WCAG compliance

### Production Integration Testing  
- React frontend deployment alongside WordPress backend
- API authentication and data fetching validation
- SSL/TLS configuration for React production build
- Performance benchmarking for full-stack application

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- WordPress API: `http://localhost:8090` (Docker container)
- React Frontend: `http://localhost:3000` (Next.js dev server)
- API Proxy: Next.js API routes for WordPress integration

### Production Environment
- WordPress API: `https://your-domain.com/api/` (Docker + Nginx + SSL)
